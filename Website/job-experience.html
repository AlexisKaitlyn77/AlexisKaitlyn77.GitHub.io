				<h6> Prime Roast - Feilding </h6>
				<p> I have been employed here since December 2015. Until January 2017, I worked only in the kitchen washing dishes, but have recently started working out the front of the shop too. My job now also includes taking orders, putting the meals together, and clearing and cleaning the tables as well as a multitude of other things. </p>
